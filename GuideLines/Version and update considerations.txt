Compatibility is a very important goal as new features are added to the C# language. We can make decisions
on adopting new features, we'll need to consider two variations of compatibility:

Binary compatible changes
Changes to your library are binary compatible when your updated library can be used without rebuilding 
applications and libraries that use it. Dependent assemblies are not required to be rebuilt, nor are any 
source code changes required. Binary compatible changes are also source compatible changes.

Source compatible changes
Changes to your library are source compatible when applications and libraries that use your library 
do not require source code changes, but the source must be recompiled against the new version to work 
correctly.

Incompatible changes
If a change is neither source compatible nor binary compatible, source code changes along with
recompilation are required in dependent libraries and applications.
